# time-tracking-pi

A raspberry pi that keeps track of time spent on tasks. 
I use this to keep track of time on different tasks at work. You can start/stop a tracker with the press of a button. Current timing is output on an LCD screen. 

Details - This uses four pins for button input. Pressing buttons 1 and 2 simultaneously will reset all tracked time to zero. Pressing buttons 1 and 3 simultaneously will exit the program. The LCD screen will show all four times either in the form of seconds, minutes, or hours + minutes. Also, the LCD screen will display a carrot '>' in front of the time that is currently still running.
